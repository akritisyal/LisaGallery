<p><i><b><font size="5">Lisa Kudrow, of LK Photographs, found her true love in landscape and travel photography. She travels as often as possible making visual memories of moments in time. Knowing not everyone is blessed with seeing these sights in person, she decided to share her work with the world. Lisa eschews fancy, expensive and cumbersome equipment, so her talent shines in spite of it, capturing images with a semi-pro camera and basic editing software.</i></b></p>

<p><i><b><font size="5">Locally, Lisa’s photographs have been accepted into juried shows at Columbia Art League. A photo of jonquils entitled “First Date” received a People’s Choice Award in an online ViewBug Challenge, voted on by over 13,000 people. Main Squeeze is hosting her first ‘One Woman Show’, and she is currently working to place her photographs in art galleries in central Missouri</i></b></p>

<p><i><b><font size="5">To end this short introduction, thanks for visiting our work, dear world! Please, feel yourself at home!</i></b></p>
